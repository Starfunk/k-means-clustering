# k-means-clustering
A simple k-means clustering algorithm for 2D data points.

Also included is a sample dataset (kmeans.csv) to test the algorithm on as well as a program (kmeans-elbow-method), which displays a graph showing how well each value of k did on the data.

Note! For some reason I have yet to figure out, the elbow graph may take a much longer time to print than normal, in these cases just relaunch the program.
